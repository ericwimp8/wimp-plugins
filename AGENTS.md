## Topical Skills (Agent Instruction)

Skills with a `topical-` prefix are implementation guides for a specific topic. They contain coding conventions, common patterns, and proven solutions for that domain.

How to use them:
- When a task touches the topic, use the matching `topical-*` skill early to understand established patterns and conventions.
- Treat the skill as a strong starting point and preferred path in many cases, not an exclusive source of truth.
- Combine skill guidance with direct codebase research (existing implementations, local patterns, and architecture) and common-sense engineering judgment.
- If codebase reality conflicts with a skill pattern, follow the codebase and adapt carefully.
- Before finishing, verify changes are consistent with both relevant skill patterns and surrounding project conventions.
